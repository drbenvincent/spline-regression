# spline-regression

Just my notes and code for learning spline / piecewise regression and Julia.

## Contents

- [Piecewise regression](piecewise%20regression.ipynb) - An introduction to piecewise constant, piecewise linear, and piecewise cubic regression models. We also look at parameter estimation.
- [Bayesian inference on piecewise regression models](piecewise_bayesian.ipynb) - Building upon the previous notebook, we look at how to do Bayesian parameter estimation on the piecewise models.
- [Basis functions and linear models](basis_functions.ipynb) - Now we move on to see how the piecewise regression models can be seen as trusty linear modelling (as in y=XÎ²) by the use of basis functions.
